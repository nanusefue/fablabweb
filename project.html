             <h4>Esteban Mart√≠n Gimenez</h4>
            <p>I was born in Buenos Aires at the early eighties. I studied there six years of electronics. My artistic restlessness made me move to Barcelona to study art and design at Massana school. Later, I returned to my engineering origins and I studied Computer sciences at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. I am now pursuing a master's degree in Systems and Robotics and work as a software engineer in a young start-up designing and implementing multiple system's architecture. Eventually, I also teach basic electronics at the multimedia design bachelor of the <a href="http://www.uols.org/es/estudiar-en-uols/grados/bachelor-en-diseno-multimedia"  target="_blank">La Salle University</a> and    parametric design <a href="http://www.escolamassana.cat/"  target="_blank">Escola Massana</a>  and fast prototyping techniques at la Massana.</p>
            <p>I keep enjoying my host-city participating in many creative events relating arts and electronics, where I've seen the birth and bloom of the makers scene. In fact, I've dedicated my final computer engineering project to create a software with NodeJS to connect and control several 3D printers online. I was invited to present that, at the <a href="https://www.fab10.org/ca/fab-festival"  target="_blank"> Fab10</a> and at the Maker Faire of NY 2014. Although I now have a long trajectory in 3D printing, I consider myself a constant learning maker, programmer, coder and designer.</p>
           <p>This last year has been particularly interesting because, together with other friends, we have funded the first <a href="http://www.diybcn.org/" target="_blank">DiyBio</a> space of Barcelona. Even my incursion in diybio is still short it has been very intense: I collaborated as teacher of bcn-node at<a href="https://www.waag.org/nl/project/biohack-academy-biofactory" target="_blank"> the biohack academy</a>. A course of 10 weeks to create several lab equipment machines. We showed them at <a href="http://makerfairebcn.org/diybiobcn-muntat-un-lab/" target="_blank">the Bcn Mini Maker faire </a>. I am particularly proud of my final Incubator and centrifuge. Also this year, together with two biohacker friends, we presented three artworks (an agar printer, small lab installation and a little humanoid robot) to <a href="http://www.cccb.org/rcs_gene/NdP__HUMANS_ENG.pdf" target="_blank"> the +Humans </a> exhibition at the Contemporary Cultural Center of Barcelona (CCCB). It is about the relation of humanity with technology in the near future. Our little diybio garage-lab, was the perfect space to start my beer brewing adventure.</p>
