<h2>Assignment</h2>
<h3>Make something big</h3>

<p>
For the assignment I have decided to create a modular lab, this lab is designed to be carried to any event, and contains several machines from a laboratory, it is also intended to be the support of my bioreactor in my final fablab project.
</p>

<p>I have used Qcad for the design of the panels that make up the modular lab.</p>

<img width="650px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week7/qcad.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>
</div>
<p>Once the 2D design is finished, I have exported a dxf file to be used in Rhino and create the 3D model and see if it has a bug, before creating the files to send to the cnc cutter.</p>

</div>

<p>Once finished the ensemble of the pieces in rhino, I bought that all the boards properly correct, I had to correct some minimal error, but in principle everything fits perfectly.
</p>

<img width="450px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week7/rhino2.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>
</div>



<p>To create the file for our cnc, we use a spatial plugins for Rhino, which is the RhinoCam, this software is used to create different strategies to cut with cnc, such as bit type, cutting type, pocketing, engraving and profile.</p>
<p>I found this tutorial on how to use rhinocam <a href="http://cmu-dfab.org/category/tutorials/router/">Tutorial</a></p>

<p>I use 5 differents setups for create my big somethings</p>

<p>Engraving for holes to fix the table in cnc.</p>

<p>Engraving for joints can fit together.</p>

<img width="650px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week7/cncrhino2.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>
</div>

<p>Pocketing for joints and letters.</p>

<div class="col-xs-12">

	<img width="450px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week7/cncrhino4.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>
</div>

<p>Profile for the external part of the modular lab.</p>

<p>Ricardo, has shown us little should be used cnc we have in fablab.</p>

<div class="col-xs-12 ">
<img width="450px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week7/cnc.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>
<img width="450px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week7/cnc1.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>

<div class="col-xs-12 ">
<img width="450px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week7/cnc2.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>
<img width="450px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week7/cnc3.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>
</div>

<p>I used the shopbot machine to cut the wood, since the other machine was not working, once set the table, first I sent the gcode to create the loaves in the wood and be able to hold it with screws and thus prevent it from moving position.</p>

<img width="450px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week7/cnc5.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>
</div>

<p>I have sent the rest of the file to cut wood, engraving for letters and joints, and the profile for external cutting.
Unfortunately the images of the assembly do not have them, to be able to ensablar everything perfectly I have used a rubber hammer and with the help of a companion in less than 20 minutes I have been able to assemble the whole module.</p>
