<h2>Assignment</h2>
<h3>Model (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate, â€¦) a possible final project, and post it on your class page.</h3>


<p>For this assignament i decide use diferentes software for 2D/3D, all most open source, and not open source.</p>
<h5>OpenSource 2D</h5>
<ul>
<li>QCad</li>
<li>Inksckape</li>
</ul>
<h5>OpenSource 3D</h5>
<ul>
<li>Openscad</li>
</ul>

And user others progran no-open source.

<h5>2D</h5>
<ul>
<li><strike>Adobe Illustrator</strike></li>
</ul>
<h5>3D</h5>
<ul>
<li>Rhino3D and Grassphoper</li>
<li>Solidworks</li>

</ul>


<h2>QCad</h2>

<p>
	QCAD is a free, open source application for computer aided drafting (CAD) in two dimensions (2D). With QCAD you can create technical drawings such as plans for buildings, interiors, mechanical parts or schematics and diagrams. QCAD works on Windows, macOS and Linux. The source code of QCAD is released under the GPL version 3 (GPLv3), a popular Open Source license. <a href='https://qcad.org/en/'>QCad</a>
</p>
<p>
There are several CAD programs for linux systems, but for my point of view the simplest is Qcad, there is a free version which has some features that are deactivated over time, but equally can be used perfectly.
Qcad is intuitive enough to use it, besides it allows to export the files in different formats and to use them in any other program of 3D to obtain a piece in volume.
I like to use Qcad to design models that will be cut in the laser cutter.

<h2>Inkscape</h2>

<p>
		Inkscape is a free, open source application for a vectorial computer designed, is similar to Illustrator, Corel Draw, and Freehand. The typical file use is SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), and the other advantage, Inkscape is cross-platform you run on Linux, Mac or Windows.
	 <a href='https://inkscape.org/es/'>Inkscape</a>
</p>
<p>
There are not many vectorial design programs for linux, Inkscape is the best known and most used by people, I personally like Illustrator much more, but there is no version for linux, inkscape is quite simple to use, I use it when I need to create trim frames or modify some path on the boards I created in Eagle, it has the possibility to export and import many file formats, such as svg, ai, dxf, eps, etc.

<h2>Openscad</h2>

<p>
	OpenScad is a software for creating solid 3D models, is open source like Inkscape or Qcad, and cross-platform.
OpenScad is perfect for creating 3D models of machine parts, Another advantage this is a super parametric software.
To create any models you must to write a script, the OpenScad renders 3D models from this script, is very easy to make any change in your model and you can be defined some variables to generate the model and change these variables to modify your model.
</p>

<p>
The interesting thing about using OpenScad is the fast one with which you can create a simple disk, in addition to that we can not parameterize our design to 100%, although it has its limitations and to make more complex models requires more knowledge of the program, with the time can be achieved more complex.
</p>
<p>
Below we see the most common functions that OpenScad has to create models.

<h4>Model example</h4>

{% highlight c linenos%}

cube([100,10,2]);
for ( i = [0 :2: 99] )
{
	 translate([i,0,0])
	 difference(){
		 translate([0,0,2])cube([2,10,2]);
		 translate([0,-1,4])rotate([0,45,0])cube([3,12,3]);

	 }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Rhino3D + Grassphoper</h2>

<p>
	<p>
	Rhino3D is software for create NURBS curve, surface and solids, point clouds, mesh.
	One of advantege in Rhino3D you can load any can off plugins, the most popular plugin is Grassphoper.
	Grassphoper is generative algorithm editor this integrate whit rhino, for create and modifid diferents models grassphopre use the flow programming paradigma.Rhino3D is software for creating NURBS curve, surface, solids, point clouds, and mesh.

<h2>SolidWorks</h2>

<p>
	SolidWorks is software for 3D modeling, oriented to Mechanical design is a great tool for creating any type of industrial design very different to Rhino or Openscad. <a href='http://www.solidworks.es/'>Solidworks</a>
</p>
<p>
The way to work with Solidworks is totally different to the different programs of generation of 3D models that I am used to use, programs like OpenScad or Rhino are worked from solids, meshes, points, curves, which can be modified by boolean operations .
Instead in SolidWorks, it is drawn from 2D planes, and what is created in these planes can be extruded, fed, bevelled. allows us to make assemblage of different parts and also the possibility to parameterize all our design.

</div>

<h2>Possible Project</h2>
<p>As a possible project, decided that the ship that would contain spirulina, also used a program called Keyshot to perform some renders, like the trial version, you can only use it, 15 days.</p>
<div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-2 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-2 ">
<img width="600px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week2/rendering/vasel.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>
</div>
<h3>Rendering Keyshot</h3>
<p>In keyshot we import our solidworks model and select each piece separately and apply the material we think is necessary, in my case I have used two materials, glass and metal, and I have changed the colors of both to make it as real as possible.</p>
<div class="col-xs-12 ">
	<img width="300px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week2/rendering/keyshot4.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>
	<img width="300px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week2/rendering/keyshot5.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>
	<img width="300px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week2/rendering/keyshot3.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>

<div class="col-xs-12 ">
	<img width="900px" src="{{ "/assets/img/project/week2/rendering/keyshot2.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt='webpage jekyll'>
</div>

<p>Here we can see the final result after adding the materials and finished the render.</p>

</div>


<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
All software used here is Magnifique, bat depends on wich you like to create, you need select the correct software.
For example for model complex and mechanical design I think is better Solidworks,
or if you like create a simple model but super parametric the best is openscad, or if you prefer to work with complex surfaces it is better to use Rhino + grasshopper.
