<h2>Assignment</h2>
<h3>Read the material safety data sheet (MSDS) and technical data sheet (TDS) for the resins that you're using</h3>

<h3>Design and make a 3D mould (~ft2 /30x30cm), and produce a fibre composite part in it</h3>

<p>I decided to create a model using solidworks, ide is to create a cover for a drone, to avoid breaking the part of the electronics if it collides with some external element.</p>

<p>I have configured the machine to make two passes with the roughing and finishing strategy, obtaining a very fine finish, this type of material being quite soft allows us to cut at maximum speed.</p>

<p>We use the Entropy Resin brand resin, specifically the "Super Sap ONF Hardener" which is ideal for laminating.</p>

<p>About this resin the fabircante says:</p>
<p>
SUPER SAP® ONE System is the industry leader for USDA BioPreferredSM   certified, ambient cure, laminating resin system. Based upon our original Super Sap 100/1000 formula, this new system features a faster speed, lowered viscosity, and includes quick air-releasing properties ideal for fiber-reinforcement composite laminations and coatings.  Super Sap® ONE was designed to achieve and excellent balance of high performance and industry leading biobased renewable content.</p>

<p>Best Uses:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fiberglass composites</li>
	<li>Natural fiber composites</li>
	<li>Woodworking</li>
	<li>Epoxy coatings</li>
	<li>Fiberglass boat repair</li>
	<li>Adhesives and sealants</li>
	<li>Surfboards, standup paddleboards and handplanes</li>
</ul>

<p>Super Sap – Make Things Better</p>
<ul>
<li>Employs new bio-based fillers for increased user safety.</li>
<li>Available in Fast cure speeds.</li>
<li>Fast Cure: 18 min pot life, 3 HR tack free time</li>
<li>Two-part epoxy resin kits are comprised of Super Sap ONE Epoxy and ONF Hardener</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the mixture is done we have a time of 18 minutes before the resin begins to cure, so it is important to have everything ready to apply the resin in our model.</p>

<p>To apply the resin we need gloves, and a spatula to spread the resin on the material.</p>

<ul>
<li>First layer: green color in the picture. Its function is to release the final piece from the mold. </li>
<li>- Second layer: here we have to add as many layers of fabric or any other material we want. Between them we have to put the mixture of components we did before. </li>
<li>- Third layer (blue in the picture): it is a microperforated plastic, so the excess of resin can go through it until the </li>
<li>- Forth layer: cotton layer that absorves the excess of resin.</li>
<li>- Fifth layer: another releasing plastic, as the bottom one.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Once together all the layers are put in the vacuum machine, so that everything fit the mold that I created in the cnc.</p>

</div>
<p>Once the drying process is finished, I realized that I forgot to put one of the plastic layers between the model and the fabric with the resin, so I had to break the mold, to get the final piece.</p>

<p>As the previous piece did not remain as I would like to, I decided to try another technique, I asked the teacher who gave us some classes on the use of resin.</p>
<p>In this case I wanted to create a resistant and flexible material, with fabric and wood sheets.</p>
<p>To get this the important thing is the position of the sheets, since I have used 3 sheets, which have been put against beta among them to achieve a greater tension, in addition to put a queen between them and as a final part I used a jean fabric so that everything is perfectly united.</p>
