<h2>Assignment</h2>

<h3>Propose a final project that integrates the range of units covered.</h3>


<h4>what will it do?</h4>

<p>The idea is to end up with a generic Î¼Cosm/bioreactor/fermentor with a modular design that allows to be adapted by the user to match the specific farming/culturing/fermenting requirements of the chosen biological specie. The device will include sensors and electronic systems to monitor control and automatize all the process, making it more resilient, productive and sustainable in a such easy way that it becomes accessible also for non-experts.
</p>

<h4>who has done what beforehand?</h4>
<p>There are several bioreactors open source version, but I did not find any that tried to grow more than one element.</p>

<h4>what materials and components will be required?</h4>
<div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-2 ">

<table class="table-striped table table-bordered" style="width: 80%">

<h4>where will they come from?</h4>
<p>Attempt to use all electronic materials from the fablab repository.
The rest of amazons and the methacrylate of a local store.</p>

<h4>how much will it cost?</h4>
<p>In the table above are the prices of each competition</p>


<h4>what parts and systems will be made?</h4>
<p>The vessel is armed for me from methacrylate pieces, such as the board that controls the bioreactor (Tinyduino), the diffuser for light, in addition to the module where the bioreactor will be.</p>

<h4>what processes will be used?</h4>
<ul>
<li>For the vessel i have used the laser</li>
<li>For the pcb the milimachine</li>
<li>For the diffuser the 3D printer</li>
<li>For the module the CNC</li>
</ul>

<!--<h4>what tasks need to be completed?</h4>-->

<h4>what questions need to be answered?</h4>
<p>Once finished know if spirulina reproduces correctly and is feasible to grow it in my own home.</p>

<h4>what is the schedule?</h4>

<p>I only have a couple of weeks to finish the whole process, some parts are already finished, like the module, and electronics, but I focus on the part of the vessel, since it needs to be correctly aligned, once this is finished, I will focus on the sensors for my bioreactor.</p>

<!--<h4>how will it be evaluated?</h4>-->
